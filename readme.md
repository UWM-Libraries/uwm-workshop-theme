## Deployment via GitHub Pages

1. Commit all changes to your repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in **Settings → Pages**.
3. Make sure the build source is set to your branch (e.g., `main`) and the correct path (root or `/docs`).
4. Wait a moment — your site should go live at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```
